# BronnBakesTimer Project Structure

This `README.md` is located in the `app/src/main/java/com/example/bronnbakestimer` directory of the BronnBakesTimer project. It provides an overview of the project's directory structure and organization, detailing the purpose of each subdirectory (subpackage) within this location, as well as the role of the current directory.

## Current Directory: `bronnbakestimer`

This directory acts as the root package for the BronnBakesTimer module of the application. It originally contained all source files, which were subsequently organized into subdirectories for improved structure. This directory now serves as a hub that connects various aspects of the application, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

## Subdirectory Overview

### ./app/
Contains core application components such as `MainActivity` and `MyApplication`.

### ./di/
Dedicated to Dependency Injection, encompassing modules like `DiModule` for dependency management.

### ./logic/
Houses business logic components, validators, and related classes, including `CountdownLogic` and `DefaultInputValidator`.

### ./model/
Comprises data models like `ExtraTimerInputsData` and `ExtraTimerUserInputData`, which represent the structure of data within the app.

### ./provider/
Provides services and wrappers for functionalities like coroutines and media playback.

### ./repository/

### ./util/
Utility classes and wrappers, providing common functionalities used across the app.

### ./viewmodel/
Contains the ViewModel, adhering to the MVVM architectural pattern.

## Project Evolution and Documentation

As the BronnBakesTimer project evolves, new modules and updates will be added directly to the appropriate subdirectories, reflecting their specific roles and functionalities within the application. This `README.md` should be updated accordingly to maintain accurate documentation of the project's structure.
