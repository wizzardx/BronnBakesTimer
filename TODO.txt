* Fix this error message: "Extra timer time cannot be greater than.." showing up in the main timer.
    - Also fix it showing up in the main error area

* Clear out main error area at the start of a "start" button press, and also when "reset" is clicked.

* Clicking Reset should also clear out the other error display areas.

* Make editing of numbers in text fields less annoying. See how I did it in the Marshalls Metronome app?

* Make the popup notification more informative/reactive/etc.

* Try to get Release APK files working from download install (it seems to work fine from Android Studio on the devices).

* Try setting these values in release mode in app/build.gradle.kts:
    - isMinifyEnabled = true
    - isShrinkResources = true
    - And check for other things to do in release mode?

* In release mode, scrolling is still a bit janky on device. Try profiling (somehow) the code again. Try also getting ChatGPT4 advice on the code I think might be causing this.

* Check that 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc wall clock time actually matches what the phone is reporting in the countdown.

* Reformat all the code in the project (but keep the builtin detekt/etc checks happy)
    - Here is one option to do that?
        - ./gradlew ktlintFormat

* Use GPT-3.5 to review each of the source code files?

* Check everything carefully on my real phone, too, not just the emulator.

* Update version from 1.2-dev to 1.2 just before releasing, after I have tested everything...
