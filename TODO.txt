* Check why rotating the screen can immediately make the timer countdown logic permanently stop.
    - The only way to get it working again on the phone seems to be to uninstall and reinstall the app, just restarting it doesn't seem to help ffs.

* Check that 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc wall clock time actually matches what the phone is reporting in the countdown.

    - It loooks like there is still a slight lag - eg if I background my app, do other things, and then come back to my app, while the android timer is running.

    - Let's do a sanity check, where I get the phone's time (in milliseconds, since I'm already getting nanos) since the start of the
      clock countdown, and then crash or something when the gap gets larger than eg 200ms?

* Use GPT-3.5 to review each of the source code files?

* Update version from 1.2-dev to 1.2 just before releasing, after I have tested everything...
    - Make sure I'm using the Release build variant.
