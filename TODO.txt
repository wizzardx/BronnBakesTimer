* Check that 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc wall clock time actually matches what the phone is reporting in the countdown.

    - It loooks like there is still a slight lag - eg if I background my app, do other things, and then come back to my app, while the android timer is running.

    - Let's do a sanity check, where I get the phone's time (in milliseconds, since I'm already getting nanos) since the start of the
      clock countdown, and then crash or something when the gap gets larger than eg 200ms?

* Use GPT-4 to review each of the source code files?

* Update version from 1.2-dev to 1.2 just before releasing, after I have tested everything...
    - Make sure I'm using the Release build variant.
