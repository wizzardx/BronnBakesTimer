* Handle the TODO tasks listed in the code.

* Check all the other code warnings, lints, etc in the code.

* Make editing of numbers in text fields less annoying. See how I did it in the Marshalls Metronome app?

* Make the popup notification more informative/reactive/etc.

* Try to get Release APK files working from download install (it seems to work fine from Android Studio on the devices).

* Try setting these values in release mode in app/build.gradle.kts:
    - isMinifyEnabled = true
    - isShrinkResources = true
    - And check for other things to do in release mode?

* In release mode, scrolling is still a bit janky on device. Try profiling (somehow) the code again. Try also getting ChatGPT4 advice on the code I think might be causing this.

* At the moment, it seems like sometimes, the extra timers and the main timers refresh on the screen at different intervals, up to around 1/3rd of a second?

* Check that 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc wall clock time actually matches what the phone is reporting in the countdown.

* After pressing Start (after a Reset), it looks like extra timers displayed time flickers a couple of times between eg 05:00 and 04:59, before finally settling at 04:59, then proceeding normally to 04:48, 04:57, etc.

(above issues seen when I have 2 extra timers on the screen).

* For debugging, let there be 2 extra timers by default? Also, all (and main) populated with convenient values to test with.

* For default values for controls, use constants (or maybe android resources?)

* Reformat all the code in the project (but keep the builtin detekt/etc checks happy)

* Update version from 1.2-dev to 1.2 just before releasing, after I have tested everything...
