* Add high unit test coverage, and maintain it?

* Convert "user input mintes"-type functions and variables, to "user input duration". And then look in the code for where minutes still occur

* Move Global Repositories into regular classes, eg TimerRepository, and then use dependency injection to get them to where they need to be, later on.

* In validateAllInputs, clear out error flags on things that we're about to set flags on.

* TODO: In validateAllInputs, set focus to the first control that has errors in the input. Also, scroll
        the vertical column so that it's visible??

* TODO: On timer completion, display a visible flag (temporarily?) next to the timer.

* TODO: Make the phone vibrate as well as buzz?

* TODO: Use what I'm learning from ChatGPT, to make the app more better?
    - especially on the Composables for deleting, adding - pass into them the actual
      functions for removing, deleting, etc, rather them them figuring it out?

* Handle the TODO tasks listed in the code.

* Make editing of numbers in text fields less annoying. See how I did it in the Marshalls Metronome app?

* Do global tidyups on the code, but be careful of upsetting existing lints.

* More unit tests.

* Make the popup notification more informative/reactive/etc.

* Try to get Release APK files working from download install (it seems to work fine from Android Studio on the devices).

* Try setting these values in release mode in app/build.gradle.kts:
    - isMinifyEnabled = true
    - isShrinkResources = true
    - Anc check for other things to do in release mode?

* In release mode, scrolling is still a bit janky on device. Try profiling (somehow) the code again. Try also getting ChatGPT4 advice on the code I think might be causing this.

* At the moment, it seems like sometimes, the extra timers and the main timers refresh on the screen at different intervals, up to around 1/3rd of a second?

* Check that 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc wall clock time actually matches what the phone is reporting in the countdown.

* After pressing Start (after a Reset), it looks like extra timers displayed time flickers a couple of times between eg 05:00 and 04:59, before finally settling at 04:59, then proceeding normally to 04:48, 04:57, etc.

(above issues seen when I have 2 extra timers on the screen).

* Add a "Seconds" debugging mode, to help me to change the timers - for debugging purposes - temporarily into debugging countdown units mode

* For debugging, let there be 2 extra timers by default? Also, all (and main) populated with convenient values to test with.

* For default values for controls, use constants (or maybe android resources?)

* Reformat all the code in the project (but keep the builtin detekt/etc checks happy)

* Detekt isn't working at the moment, check why?

* Use a function for converting from user input, to seconds, according to the current timer units being used. Change timer units into input units.

* Check unit test coverage again

* Looks like Live Preview is broken again

* Looks like reactivity between main timer minutes input, and the displayed time remaining, is broken again...

* Looks like remaining time - when you click start for main timer, is different to the user input, even if you do nothing. eg at 6 minutes rather than 5 minute
